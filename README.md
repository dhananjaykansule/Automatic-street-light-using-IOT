# Automatic-street-light-using-IOT
Automatic street light system using IoT to detect sunlight intensity with an LDR sensor. Based on the data, the street lights turn ON/OFF and adjust brightness as needed, saving energy. The system is controlled by an Arduino UNO, optimizing power consumption based on real-time light conditions.
